# Backend/store:
 Optimize multiple backend requests: backends declare their
 categories, so store could be able to know which backend needs to be
 requested.

# Parsers
Migrate to single parse/3 API with state containing request type (see
   text/occi and text/plain parsers)

Rewrite parsers (XML, JSON) with sequential code

# Categories management

occi_category_mgr must not return actions separatly from kind/mixin

# OCCI meta-model
 Handle OCCI inheritance

# Replace lists (strings) with binaries: uris

# Handle multiple listeners


# Build

* Check for c++ (jiffy)
* Platform dependant checks: statfs, etc
